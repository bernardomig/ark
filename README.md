Ark is a project with a dedication to being the home of many models and training techniques. Deep Learning practitioners and developers can find many well written and explained models for computer vision developed in Pytorch, and pre-trained for many tasks. This library is still under heavy development, but if you find tempted to help us by contributing or sponsoring, do not hesitate!
